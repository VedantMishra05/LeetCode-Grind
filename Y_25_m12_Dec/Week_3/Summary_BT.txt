Max Depth : Maximum levels of a tree
    If the current node is null then we have reached the bottom and we return '0'. Then we keep on adding till reach
    the root node, which gives us the depth.


Same Tree : Similarty of a tree
    Check if both the current nodes of both trees are same or not in value(number or null). If they are same and
    null true return true. If same and not null, run the same checks for the branch nodes. If different, return false.

Balanced Binary Tree : Depth of two subtrees never differ by more than '1'.
