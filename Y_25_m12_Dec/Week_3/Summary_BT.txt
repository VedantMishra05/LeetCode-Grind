Max Depth : Maximum levels of a tree
    If the current node is null then we have reached the bottom and we return '0'. Then we keep on adding till reach
    the root node, which gives us the depth.


Same Tree : Similarty of a tree
    Check if both the current nodes of both trees are same or not in value(number or null). If they are same and
    null true return true. If same and not null, run the same checks for the branch nodes. If different, return false.

Balanced Binary Tree : Depth of two subtrees never differ by more than '1'.
    My Soln:
        I just check the max depth of left and right nodes constantly. If their difference is greater than '1' then false.
    Optimal Soln:
        Almost same hai, but, mere waale me ham top level tak calculate kar rahe the. Isme niche se hi calculate karte aa 
        raha hai. Agar difference kahi -1 aaya to return aur kisi ka value aaya -1 to return. No extra calculation. Agle
        call me 1 + dono me se max . '1 + ' isliye kyuki height badhana hai na. 

Symmetric Tree : Mirror nodes
    From root node, compare left and right nodes. If both left and right are null, then okay. If either of them is null 
    then bad or if both their values are not same then also bad. If eveery condition is right, their value is same and 
    their are more nodes. So compare, left.left with right.right (mirror) and vice versa.

Minimum Depth of Binary Tree : Using Queues         [ CODE BACHA HAI LIKHNA ]
    We use a queue and offer the root node. While the queue is not empty, we offer all available child nodes (after checking)
    and increase depth every iteration. If both child nodes are null, we return depth. Node node = queue.poll();
