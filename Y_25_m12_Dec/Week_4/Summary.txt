Detele given node :
    Well, it is not complicated. We just copy the data of the next node and then skip the next node. Creating an 
    illusion that we deleted the given (provided that the given node is not the tail node).

Intersection of two linked lists :
    We are given two linked list's heads. 

Length of largest palindrome : 
    For this we just have to store the frequency of every character in the given string. If we have even no.of 
    characters, we add the count (both will be part of palindrome). If we have odd no.of characters, then we 
    add one less count (ek kam karne ke baad even ho gaya na), and change hasOdd to true. 
    Last me add '1' for the center character.
