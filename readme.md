# 📘 DSA Grind Journal

This repository documents my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) learning journey**.

The goal of this repo is **not just to solve problems**, but to:
- Build strong fundamentals
- Track my consistency
- Reflect on mistakes and improvements
- Think clearly about *why* a solution works, not just *how*

This is a **learning journal**, not a showcase of perfect code.

---

## 🎯 Why this repository exists

- To stay **accountable** during my DSA grind
- To record **what I learn every week**
- To track patterns in mistakes and gaps in understanding
- To improve problem-solving thinking, not memorization
- To look back later and see real progress

I believe writing about learning makes understanding deeper and more permanent.

## 🛠️ What this repository contains

- 📂 Weekly folders with solved problems
- 🧠 Notes and explanations (when needed)
- 🔁 Revisited problems and optimized solutions
- 📝 Reflections on what went well and what didn’t

## 🚀 Long-term Goal

To become confident in:
- Problem decomposition
- Choosing the right data structure
- Writing clean and efficient solutions
- Explaining my thought process clearly

Consistency > speed.  
Understanding > memorization.

## 🧩 Final Note

This repository is a **work in progress**, just like my learning.

Mistakes are expected.  
Confusion is normal.  
Progress is guaranteed if I don’t stop.

📈 One problem at a time.
