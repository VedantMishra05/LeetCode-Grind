#  DSA Grind Journal

This repository documents my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) learning journey**.

The goal of this repo is to:
- To stay **accountable** during my DSA grind
- To record **what I learn every week**
- To track patterns in mistakes and gaps in understanding
- To improve problem-solving thinking, not memorization
- To look back later and see real progress

This is a **learning journal**, where I experiment but keep on practicing.
I believe writing about learning makes understanding deeper and more permanent.

##  What this repository contains

-  Weekly folders with solved problems
-  Notes and explanations (when needed)
-  Revisit problems and optimize solutions
-  Reflections on the week's progress and performance in summary.txt in each folder
-  Monthly progress report and thoughts in the readme.md file

##  Monthly Reflection Journal

Below is a running log of my thoughts, struggles, and improvements each month.

- ### Dec 2025:
      During this month, I solved the first questions on binary trees and they were comparitively easy compared
      to the hype created. I switched from Kunal Kushwaha's playlist to Take you forward's playlist. I fully 
      mastered linked list after arrays and strings. Next target is to master (cover every topic) Stacks, Queues 
      and Binary Trees. For now, I will move on to practice Backtracking and Graphs next month.
    Problem of the month: **Largest Rectangle in Histogram**

##  Long-term Goal

To become confident in:
- Pattern Recognition and Problem Solving
- Choosing the right data algorithm to minimize time complexity
- Writing clean and industry standard solutions
- Explaining my thought process clearly

Consistency > speed.  
Understanding > memorization.

##  Final Note

This repository is a **work in progress**, just like my learning.

Mistakes are expected.  
Confusion is normal.  
Progress is guaranteed if I don’t stop.

One problem at a time. 😁
