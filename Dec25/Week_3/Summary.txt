Detect Cycle in a ll :
    For detecting  cycle in a linked list, we take two pointers from the head position of a linked list. Give one 
    double the speed of normal pointer. If later, they point to the same node then they are in a cycle as in a 
    linear list they would not have met. Value of a node can be same but the exact node pointer cannot be same.

Happy Number : Square of Digits eventually equal to 1
    Ek function to alag se hoga hi, square of digits nikalne ke liye. Isse agla num milega. Use floyd's algo.
    If fast pointer is equal to the slow pointer, then values are repeating and we are repeating in a loop, so 
    then we compare if we are repeating at value '1'. If yes then 'OK' or else.

Max Depth : Maximum levels of a tree
    If the current node is null then we have reached the bottom and we return '0'. Then we keep on adding till reach
    the root node, which gives us the depth.


Same Tree : Similarty of a tree
    Check if both the current nodes of both trees are same or not in value(number or null). If they are same and
    null true return true. If same and not null, run the same checks for the branch nodes. If different, return false.
