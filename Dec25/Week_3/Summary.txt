Detect Cycle in a ll :
    For detecting  cycle in a linked list, we take two pointers from the head position of a linked list. Give one 
    double the speed of normal pointer. If later, they point to the same node then they are in a cycle as in a 
    linear list they would not have met. Value of a node can be same but the exact node pointer cannot be same.

Recursive insertion in a ll :
    

Happy Number : Square of Digits eventually equal to 1
    S

Max Depth : Maximum levels of a tree
    

Same Tree : Similarty of a tree
    Check if both the current nodes of both trees are same or not in value(number or null). If they are same and
    null true return true. If same and not null, run the same checks for the branch nodes. If different, return false.
